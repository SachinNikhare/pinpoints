# Pinpoints.com | Your URL Shortener

An online service called a URL shortener shortens your URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The goal is to make the web page address shorter and simpler to remember and navigate.

The URL shortening service you select will keep the old link and the new link connected. Anyone who clicks on your new link will therefore be taken back to the original website.
